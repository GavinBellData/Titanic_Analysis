# Titanic_Analysis
This is a repository(Repo) to store an analysis of the Titanic dataset.

I have a few ideas involving this repo and hopefully others to follow. I would like to create a space for my own data science projects with full notes and thought processes on the execution of the project. I also have the idea of creating tutorials in the future similar to those like David Langer/Alex the Analyst. 

I've always found that I learn best by doing and following along with my own space, but have never found an outlet that meets my wants/needs. I've always had the inkling of making my own

My career in data science is probably typical of many others where the vastness of tools and process has seemed overwhelming and the positons I hold only allow me to flex a portion of what a Data Analyst/Scientist/Enginerr/Architect/Steward skillset would be. I was always drawn in by the story telling and let down at the incompleteness for a project or the lack of resources and time. 

This is my outlet. I've currently been technically homeless for going on eleven months while also working my first data scientist positon for ten months. It's been a stressful whirlwind of let downs and misplaced expectations. I thought as I progressed in my carreer from analyst to analytics manager to scientist I would scratch the itch of doing actual analysis, but my truth is that I still feel incomplete even in my success.

I ultimately don't know what this will be. It could be just another repo where half baked data science goes to die, I could fufill my want and make my own series of tutorials and never find a way to set myself apart from the thousands of others, or it could just be professional site for employers whom never read this.

I've had a particularly hard several weeks as of writing this and have felt rather beaten down by life. I'm still hopeful though. 

We shall see.
